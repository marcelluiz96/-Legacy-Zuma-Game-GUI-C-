## Synopsis

This C++ + SDL implementation of the "Zuma" game - tile-matching puzzle game -, was a project made around 2013 during my first years of college.
Although the code probably won't look as good (due to those being my first programming years), it contains some solid implementations which can be used in other student's projects.

## Authors

- Lucas Pinheiro Otaviano André (Github: St4rk), which made this project far better than i would have alone. Also memory-leak free <3.
- Marcel Luiz de Oliveira Mendonça (Github: marcelluiz96)

## Useful methods

Along follow some of the methods that may be of use in similar projects:

### Core

- Soft movement implementation
- Collision
- Time-based frame updating for underlying data and view sync
- Route-following movement

### Other

- Background and custom sprites loading
- Text rendering over the screen
- Key listeners
- Main menu and credits
- FPS counter
- .txt mapping to a matrix (for the game levels)

## Contact

If you're reading this, you might be desperate for help, or bored as hell. But hey! If you need help finding anything in the code, or with C++/SDL overall,
just contact me at 'marcelluiz96@hotmail.com'! I'm a bit rusty, but i'll be as solicitous as possible.

Also, St4rk is working on Microsoft now. This is where it began. Jk.
